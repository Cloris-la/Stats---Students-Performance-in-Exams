    "Short Report: Key Insights from Visualizations\n",
    "1. Math Score by Gender (box_math_score_by_gender.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Insight: The median math scores for males and females are very close, but the distribution of scores among males is more spread out. This means there is greater variability in math performance among male students, with both very high and very low scorers, while female students' scores are more concentrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Math Score by Test Preparation Course (box_math_score_by_test_preparation_course.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Insight: Students who completed the test preparation course show a significantly higher median math score and an overall better score distribution than those who did not. This suggests a strong association between taking the preparation course and improved math performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Reading Score by Gender (box_reading_score_by_gender.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Insight: Females demonstrate a higher median and a higher interquartile range in reading scores compared to males. This is a noticeable difference, indicating that, in this dataset, female students generally outperform males in reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Reading Score by Lunch (box_reading_score_by_lunch.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Insight: Students with a standard lunch have significantly higher reading scores than those with free/reduced lunch. This may imply that socioeconomic status is an important factor influencing academic performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Reading Score by Parental Level of Education (box_reading_score_by_parental_level_of_education.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Insight: A positive correlation is observed between parental education level and students' reading scores. Students whose parents have higher educational qualifications (e.g., bachelor's or master's degree) typically have higher median reading scores. This indicates that family educational background has a positive impact on student achievement.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Reading Score by Race/Ethnicity (box_reading_score_by_race_ethnicity.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Insight: Observable differences in reading scores exist among different racial/ethnic groups. The median score of certain groups (e.g., group E) is significantly higher than that of others (e.g., group A). This highlights an imbalance in performance distribution across demographic groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Reading Score by Test Preparation Course (box_reading_score_by_test_preparation_course.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Insight: Similar to the trend in math scores, students who completed the test preparation course also show a significant advantage in reading. This further validates the effectiveness of the preparatory course.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Distribution of Writing Score (hist_writing_score.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Insight: The distribution of writing scores is approximately normal (bell-shaped), with the majority of students scoring between 60 and 80 points. There are fewer students at the very high and very low ends of the spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Writing Score by Gender (box_writing_score_by_gender.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Insight: Consistent with the finding for reading scores, females also overall outperform males in writing, showing a higher median and a higher upper quartile range.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Writing Score by Test Preparation Course (box_writing_score_by_test_preparation_course.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Insight: The test preparation course also has a positive effect on writing scores. The score distribution of students who completed the course is shifted to the right (toward higher scores), indicating the course's benefit across all three subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Correlation Heatmap (correlation_heatmap.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Insight: There is a very strong positive correlation (coefficients close to 1) between scores in math, reading, and writing, with the correlation between reading and writing being the highest. This means a student who performs well in one subject is highly likely to perform well in the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall Summary\n",
    "This analysis reveals several key factors influencing student exam performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Test Preparation Course: This is the most consistent and effective factor in improving scores across all subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gender Differences: Clear differences exist; females show an advantage in reading and writing, while males show greater variability in math scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Socioeconomic Factors: Factors like lunch type and parental education level show a positive correlation with performance, suggesting that students with better resources tend to perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subject Correlation: The scores of the three core subjects (math, reading, writing) are highly correlated, indicating that student learning ability is comprehensive.\n",
    "\n",
